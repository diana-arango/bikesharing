# Des Moines Program

The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors to consider the bike-sharing program in Des Moines as a solid business proposal. For the study Pandas and Tableau were used to visualize the bike trip analysis.

## Analysis

### Customers: 

•	Total of customers: 2,344,224
•	81% of the CitiBike users are subscribers, 19% are Customers
•	Most of CitiBike users are male with a total count of 1,530,272. Women followed with a total count of 588,431 individuals
 

### Checkout times:

•	Data studied: Rides in August 2019
•	CitiBike services were highly used at rush hours: 8:00 am, 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm
 
•	Upper Manhattan was the top location were rides started and ended daily 

 
•	A study performed during a 24-hour day determined that most of users took advantage of the ride service for 5 minutes. Instead, there were fewer customers who took long rides of approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Men were the mainly riders 

 

### Weekday trips:
•	Bikes are considerably used during weekdays. Specially Thursday at 8: 00 am and rush hour between 5:00 pm and 6: 00 pm. Subscribers, mainly men are the top users 

 
### Summary: 

It was concluded that the CitiBike program is a success in NYC, and it could be implemented at Des Moines as long as the customer profiles remain similar to current. Men are the main users of the service as bikes seem to be mostly used for short distance rides. I suggest to study the inventory of the bikes and its maintenance to determine how many potential rides could be lost for bike damages or if bikes are not used for longer trips due to performance
